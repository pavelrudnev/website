A team of researchers at HSE, including myself, has recently been awarded a highly competitive and prestigious grant by the [**Russian Science Foundation**](https://rscf.ru). Over the next few years, we'll be investigating non-finite constructions in a number of severely understudied languages of Russia (Avar, Bagwalal, Udi, Agul, Hill Mari, Meadow Mari, Northern Khanty, Chukchi). The project's title is *When the verb isn't a verb: Non-finite constructions in the languages of Russia*, and you can read more about it [**here**](http://rscf.ru/en/enprjcard/?rid=18-78-10128).
