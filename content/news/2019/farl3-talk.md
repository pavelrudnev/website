I have recently given a presentation at the third installment of the Formal Approaches to Russian Linguistics workshop at Lomonosov Moscow State University. In my talk, I have tried to adapt an exhaustification analysis of PPI-disjunction to the facts of Russian. An abstract and a set of slides are available [**here**](/presentation/2019/farl3/).
