I will present my recent work on the PPI-behaviour of the Russian plain disjunction marker *ili* at the 33rd annual meeting of the [Israel Association for Theoretical Linguistics](https://www.iatl.org.il/?page_id=1139). In the talk, I argue that that behaviour as well as the apparent exceptions can be derived from the phrasal versus clausal character of the disjunction, and the status of Russian as a negative concord language.
