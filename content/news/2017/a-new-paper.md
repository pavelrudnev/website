My paper on long-distance anaphora in Avar has finally appeared in *Studia Linguistica*. In it I offer a detailed description of the distribution of two long-distance reflexives---*žiwgo* and *žiw*.

If this looks interesting to you, please [take a look](https://pavelrudnev.github.io/papers/minimalpronouns/). I'd appreciate your feedback. Thanks!
