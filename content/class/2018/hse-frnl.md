### Introduction ###

The course will provide the following learning outcomes:

1. To understand the logic behind several important theories of syntax and its interactions with sound and meaning.
2. To be able to apply that understanding to evaluate the relevance of those theories and their limitations with respect to Russian.
3. To be able to apply the scientific method to analyse several empirical phenomena in Russian.

### Assessment ###

The course will be assessed by one 4,500-word essay critically reviewing one original research article pertaining to the course's main topics.
