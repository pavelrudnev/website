### Introduction ###

The course will provide the following learning outcomes:


1. learning the architecture and the internal logic of individual theoretical models on various levels of language
structure, including phonology, morphophonology, syntax, semantics and discourse
2. developing skills in application of these theories in modelling empirical data and describing individual
languages
3. training in formal and not-so-formal linguistic theories and way of theoretical thinking they are associated
with

The topic for my part of this course is **Modularity in linguistic theory**, and the discussion will focus on the tension between Minimalism and Cartography and the relationship between syntax and information structure.
