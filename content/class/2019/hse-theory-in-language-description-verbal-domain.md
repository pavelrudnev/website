This course is for 1st-year MA students. It provides the following learning outcomes:


1. learning the architecture and the internal logic of individual theoretical models on various levels of language
structure, including phonology, morphophonology, syntax, semantics and discourse
2. developing skills in application of these theories in modelling empirical data and describing individual
languages
3. training in formal and not-so-formal linguistic theories and way of theoretical thinking they are associated
with

This year, the topic for my part of this course, jointly developed and taught by [Anna Volkova](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/110633347) and myself, is **The verbal domain**, and the discussion will focus on the relation between argument structure and event structure. The schedule is as follows:

1. The structure of the verbal domain
    * Î¸-roles and Case assignment
    * Burzio's generalisation; Arity operations
2. Diagnosing unaccusativity crosslinguistically
    * theoretical and psycholinguistic studies of unaccusativity
3. Event structure and participant roles
    * event decomposition (Ramchand 2008)
    * verb classes, case and agreement in ergative-absolutive languages
