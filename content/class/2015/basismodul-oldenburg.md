This course introduces the basic concepts, methods and fields of linguistics and deals with language as a cognitive ability as well as language as a system. In the first term, special emphasis will be on the phonological, morphological and syntactic properties of English.

There are 9 lectures grouped in blocks and interspersed by reading weeks (please, check [StudIP](https://elearning.uni-oldenburg.de/dispatch.php/course/details/index/34bf203ee9731de1de5a44b708ed0ee9) for the syllabus and exact dates and times).

The course will be accompanied by weekly exercises, which are compulsory, accompany the lecture and independently treat the phonology of English (see StudIP for the syllabus). There are also optional tutorials which are highly recommended for getting accustomed to terminology and methodology. In summer, the module will be complemented by a course on the phonetics, semantics/pragmatics and history of the English language.

**Reading:** A reader will be distributed during the first lectures.

The material for the phonology part will be made available as powerpoint presentations after each exercise session.
