The present thesis provides a detailed description of the syntactic and semantic properties of a number of related constructions in Avar, a Northeast Caucasian language. These include relativisation, wh-questions and focus sentences, all of which are created via a dependency between an abstract operator and a variable. In addition to the description a generative analysis is developed whereby the relative clause is treated as the structural core for the remaining constructions.
