This paper is concerned with the syntax and semantics of the Turkish pronominal element *kendisi* ‘self.3SG’ that has so far received very little attention in the literature on anaphoric relations. We start out by examining the properties of this pronoun proceeding next to discuss the few existing proposals highlighting their inadequacies when confronted with novel data. We argue that despite its reflexive root, *kendisi* should be treated as a pronominal for the purposes of the Binding Theory, and should be sensitive to Condition B.
