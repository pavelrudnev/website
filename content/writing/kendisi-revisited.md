The present contribution follows up on Rudnev 2011, which, in turn, was based on a presentation I gave in Barbara Partee's semantics class in the spring of 2008. It is for this reason that I omit most of the arguments for the pronominal nature of kendisi and present a formalisation of its semantic properties based on Partee 1983 and Elbourne 2008.
