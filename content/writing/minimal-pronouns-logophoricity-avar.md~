This paper discusses two morphologically related anaphoric pronouns in Avar (Avar-Andic, Nakh-Daghestanian) and proposes that one of them should be treated as a minimal pronoun that receives its interpretation from a Î»-operator situated on a phasal head whereas the other is a logophoric pronoun denoting the author of the reported event.
