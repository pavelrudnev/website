**Abstract** 

Given the central spot afforded to unvalued features in current theorizing, the directionality of feature valuation is the subject of a lively debate in the syntactic literature. The traditional conception of upward valuation, whereby the unvalued probe inherits features from a valued goal in its c-command domain (ChomskyÂ 2000, 2001a, Carstens 2013, Preminger 2013), has to compete with downward valuation (Zeijlstra 2012),  Hybrid Agree (Bjorkman & Zeijlstra 2018), bidirectional Agree (Baker 2008), amongst others.

The present paper discusses, using data from Avar, a crosslinguistically rare phenomenon of adposition agreement, whereby certain adverbs, postpositions and locative case forms undergo agreement with an absolutive argument.  I show that the agreement morphology on agreeing adpositions is a result of agreement rather than concord and explore the consequences of adposition agreement in Avar for upward and downward valuation. I conclude that upward valuation is better equipped to account for the observed patterns than downward valuation, both on empirical and conceptual grounds.

The paper is currently undergoing peer review; yet, if you feel you would like an intermediate draft of it, please get in touch with me.
