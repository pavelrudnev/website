Given the well-attested selectional asymmetries between clauses and nominals, selection-based empirical arguments for the projection of functional structure in the noun phrase are especially pertinent for the debate regarding the syntax of nominal phrases. One such argument is the selection of ‘small nominals’ by a Russian aspectual prefix. This paper reports naturally occurring and experimental data showing that the Russian cumulative aspectual prefix *na-* is equally compatible with nominals with and without adnominal modifiers and therefore does not c-select a ‘small nominal’, contrary to all existing claims in the literature. Russian ‘small nominals’ thus provide no evidence for the selection of functional structure in the noun phrase, and the observed restrictions follow from the semantics of the prefix and how it interacts with the semantics of the event description.
