The present paper applies Multiple Correspondence Analysis to test the validity of an existing theoretical model of the phonological system of Russian Sign Language (RSL). We show that comparing the importance of phonological features using ratio plots and MCA is a promising way of revealing non-binary oppositions in phonological systems of human languages irrespective of modality.
