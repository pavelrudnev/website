This paper is concerned with the distribution of reflexive and non-reflexive pronouns in local anaphoric configurations in (three dialects of) Russian Sign Language (RSL). We demonstrate that most of the observed facts can be accounted for on a Binding Theory supplemented by a version of the Coreference Rule (BÃ¼ring 2005). We also show that an additional mechanism, *coreference via the signing space*, is required to explain certain cases of non-complementarity. A related mechanism is proposed to account for similar facts in spoken languages.
