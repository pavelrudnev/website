**Abstract** 

Nicolae (2017) develops an account of PPI-disjunctions whereby
the unacceptability of plain disjunction in DE-environments results from
an economy condition imposed on obligatory exhaustification. This remark
shows this general mechanism to be insufficient to account for the
behaviour of the Russian plain disjunction marker *ili*, whose scope properties are
argued to correlate with the phrasal vs.Â clausal nature of the disjunction:
phrasal disjunction yields narrow scope whilst clausal disjunction yields
wide scope.

The paper is currently down for revision; yet, if you feel you would like an intermediate draft of it, please get in touch with me.
