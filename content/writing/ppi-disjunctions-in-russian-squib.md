**Abstract** 

Nicolae (2017) develops an account of PPI-disjunctions whereby
the unacceptability of plain disjunction in DE-environments results from
an economy condition imposed on obligatory exhaustification. This commentary
shows this general mechanism to be insufficient to account for the
behaviour of the Russian plain disjunction marker *ili*, whose scope properties are
argued to correlate with the phrasal vs.Â clausal nature of the disjunction:
phrasal disjunction yields narrow scope whilst clausal disjunction yields
wide scope.
