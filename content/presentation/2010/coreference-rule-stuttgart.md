(with Vadim Kimmelman)

In this talk we present a detailed description of the behaviour of various classes of (anaphoric) pronouns in three dialects of the Russian Sign Language and compare them with the distribution of similar pronouns in Turkish. 


**Keywords:** syntax, semantics, binding theory, Russian Sign Language, Turkish, coreference

This is a peer-reviewed talk at the [Peculiar Binding Configurations](http://www.ilg.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/konferenz/binding2010/program.html) workshop  at the [University of Stuttgart](http://uni-stuttgart.de).
