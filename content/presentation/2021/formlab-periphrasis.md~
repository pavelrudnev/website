It is a robust empirical generalisation that, crosslinguistically, nonfinite verbal forms (infinitives, participles, converbs and nominalisations) can head clauses of their own as well as form a part of compound, periphrastic forms expressing a variety of meanings (tense, aspect, modality and evidentiality). In this talk, I systematise what is known about the various types of such multifunctional nonfinites in Avar and attempt to situate them on the theoretical landscape. I argue that all periphrastic TAME-forms in Avar involve vP-restructuring whereby an auxiliary verb, *be*, takes a nonfinite lexical vP (whether it is an infinitive, a converb or a participle) as its complement. I conclude that the Avar facts are better compatible with Merge/Selection rather than the insertion approaches to verbal periphrasis.
