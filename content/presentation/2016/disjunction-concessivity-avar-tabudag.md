*Abstract*: This paper discusses a previously neglected disjunction strategy in Avar (NE Caucasian),
whereby each disjunct is accompanied by a morphologically complex disjunction
marker *=nigi* yet the disjunction is not interpreted exclusively, unlike the reduplicated discontinuous disjunctions like *soit\_soit* in French.

The disjunction marker is exponentially identical with the particle attaching to indefinites
and turning them into polarity items: *šib=nigi* ‘what=POL (ie someting/nothing)’
as well as the marker of concessivity that attaches to verbs.
In this paper I attempt to unify the approach to particles developed by
Wiltschko (2016) with the analysis of particle float in Avar (Rudnev 2015). 

This is a  talk presented at the 37th installment of [TaBu Dag](http://www.let.rug.nl/tabudag/), an annual general linguistics conference organised by the University of Groningen, 3rd June 2016.
