*Abstract*: In this talk I show that the positive-polarity status of the plain disjunction marker *ili* ‘or’ in Russian correlates with the phrasal vs. clausal nature of disjunction.

This is a peer-reviewed talk, for the 33rd annual meeting of the [Israel Association for Theoretical Linguistics](https://www.iatl.org.il/?page_id=1139), in Tel-Aviv.
