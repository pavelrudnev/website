*Abstract*: In this talk, I develop a configurational approach to case and agreement in the Avar biabsolutive constructions.

This is a peer-reviewed talk, for the 35th annual meeting of the [Israel Association for Theoretical Linguistics](https://www.iatl.org.il/?page_id=1646), at The Open University in Ra'anana.
