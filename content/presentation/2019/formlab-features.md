This talks provides an overview of approaches to featural dependencies in current minimalist work starting from Chomsky (1995). I also discuss aspects of the theory of feature structure which, though often taken for granted, present non-trivial challenges to developing explanatory analyses of featural dependencies. In addition to ϕ-features, the features I discuss are as follows:

  * interpretable vs. uninterpretable
  * valued vs. unvalued
  * second-order features/EPP-features
  * features-of-features ([E]-features)
  * formal wh-features
  * formal information-structural features
  
I conclude, in broad agreement with Šimík (2012) and Boeckx (2015), that the only domain where postulating formal features does not lead to problems are morphosyntactic agreement phenomena.
