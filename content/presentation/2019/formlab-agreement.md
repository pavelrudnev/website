This talk discusses a recent approach to ϕ-agreement as formulated in Bjorkman & Zeijlstra to appear. According to that approach, all probing relations are established by probing “upwards”, and all exceptions traditionally analysed as involving probing “downwards” are viewed as being parasitic on such Upwards-Agree relations. By looking at \(ϕ\)-agreement patterns in two morphologically ergative East-Caucasian languages, Mehweb and Avar, I identify what I view as insurmountable empirical hurdles to Bjorkman & Zeijlstra's analysis. I also identify a number of conceptual issues with their analysis.
