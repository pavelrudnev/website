In this talk I discuss a number of restrictions on sentential negation marking in Avar, a Northeast Caucasian language, and sketch a tentative analysis of the observed morphosyntactic facts as having a semantic basis. The two different negation markers (*-ro* and *-č'o*) are analysed, based on the proposal in Ramchand & Svenonius 2014, as taking complements of a different syntactic size and semantic type.

In particular, I show that the two negation markers attested in Avar differ in the type of semantic object they can compose with: for the present and future tenses *-ro* combines with a Fin*P denoting a set of propositions, whereas past-tense negation utilises the biclausal predicational strategy.

The question why past tense forms cannot combine with *-ro* has remained unanswered. It remains to be seen whether the proposal made for *-č’o* can be made compatible with the use of the present-tense negative copula/auxiliary *heč’o* as the auxiliary in analytic verb forms.

I further draw a number of cross-linguistic comparisons between Avar on the one hand, and Bengali, Mebengokre and the Salish languages on the other.
