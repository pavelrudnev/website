This talk discusses East Caucasian coordination strategies from the viewpoint of recent decompositional approaches to “logical” vocabulary (words like *and*, *or*, *not* etc.) as pursued by Mitrović (2014). Focusing on the predictions of that analysis concerning the unavoidability of exclusivity inferences in the case of reduplicated pairs of μ- and κ-particles, I identify a disjunction strategy in Avar that casts doubt on the universality of the analysis and suggest possible workarounds.
