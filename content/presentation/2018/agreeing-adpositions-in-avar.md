Given the central spot afforded to unvalued features in current
minimalist theorizing, the directionality of feature valuation is the
subject of a lively debate in the syntactic literature. The
traditional conception of upward valuation, whereby the unvalued probe
inherits features from a valued goal in its c-command domain (Chomsky
2000, 2001, Carstens & Diercks 2013, Preminger 2013), has to compete
with downward valuation (Zeijlstra 2012), Hybrid Agree (Bjorkman &
Zeijlstra to appear), bidirectional Agree (Baker 2008), amongst others.

This talk discusses, using data from Avar, a crosslinguistically rare
phenomenon of adposition agreement, whereby certain adverbs,
postpositions and locative-marked noun phrases undergo agreement with
an absolutive argument. I show that the agreement morphology on
agreeing adpositions is a result of agreement rather than concord, and
explore the consequences of adposition agreement in Avar for upward
and downward valuation. I conclude that the traditional conception of
upward valuation is both conceptually and empirically superior to its
alternatives.
